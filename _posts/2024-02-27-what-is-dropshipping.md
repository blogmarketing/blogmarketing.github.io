## What is dropshipping? 

In traditional online stores, maintaining an inventory of products ready for shipping is standard practice.

However, with dropshipping, you eliminate the need to manufacture or store the products you sell. Instead, upon receiving customer orders, you transmit them to a supplier, who then ships the products directly to the buyers. This streamlined process alleviates inventory concerns, as the supplier manages both inventory and shipping.

### Key players in dropshipping: Retailer, supplier, and customer

Dropshipping revolves around three pivotal roles, each contributing to a seamless shopping experience:

- You (Retailer): You curate and sell products in your online store, handle marketing, customer communication, and overall shop management.
- Supplier: Possessing the products, suppliers manage shipping upon receiving orders.
- Customer: These individuals purchase the products you offer.

### Advantages of dropshipping for SMBs

Explore the numerous benefits dropshipping offers small to medium-sized businesses:

- Low Startup Costs: Minimal capital is required to initiate operations. Focus on creating an appealing shop and spreading awareness among your target audience.
- Reduced Inventory Risks: With dropshipping, you only purchase what you sell, mitigating concerns about unsold inventory.
- Wider Product Selection: Offer a diverse range of products without the need for extensive storage space.
- Location Independence: Enjoy the flexibility to work from anywhere, provided you have a computer and internet access.
- Scalability Opportunities: As your business expands, suppliers handle increased orders, eliminating worries about storage constraints.

### Is dropshipping for you?

Discover if dropshipping aligns with your objectives through these personas:
